#Welcome to my GitHub!

###I am a Full Stack/Front End Web Developer with a passion for creating elegant websites using simple, clean code to showcase a brandâ€™s personality and products. Through collaboration and teamwork, I aim to motivate disparate teams towards a shared goal. Motivated by challenge and naturally a troubleshooter, my goal is to effectively communicate ideas and strategies with my colleagues and become a reliable knowledge base.

###When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing basketball, cooking, and watching the Yankees, Jets, and Knicks.
