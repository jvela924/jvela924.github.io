# Settle The Score
## What is Settle The Score
### Use Settle The Score to retrieve season averages for your favorite NBA players and debate amongst your friends who's the better player. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery:
#### HTML
HTML is the standard langauge for creating web pages. It defines the structure of a web page.
#### CSS
CSS is a langauge that defines how your HTML elements are displayed within your web page. 
#### JS
JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things and create dynamic web page.
#### JQuery
JQuery is a JS library that makes running JS on your web page easier. You can use JQuery methods to complete complex JS functions in a single line of code.
## The Approach
#### Wireframe
Once I fleshed out the concept, I started to think about what I want my site to look like. I created a wireframe using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc)

![Wireframe](https://github.com/jvela924/jvela924.github.io/blob/master/settle-the-score-app/images/screenshot.png)

#### Setting up the basic page structure
Based on the wireframe, I started with my HTML file. I created all of my containers, and added in content where necessary. Then, I created the CSS and JS files, and I linked them to the HTML file to make sure everything was working.

#### API
After doing some research, I found a public API (on reddit) to use to get the data I needed for my site. [balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction) seemed fairly easy to use and had some simple documentation. 

#### JS and JQuery
I started with building my ajax call to make sure I could retrieve data from the API before moving forward. Using JS, I was able to get the data I needed and log it to the console. Then, I used JQeury to place that data onto the page. Once I had the basic call structure down, I was ready to move on and build the more complex JS and JQeury functionality/
